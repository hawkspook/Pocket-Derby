Small App Preload GPT4 Prompt - chat in a small app and discuss

This performs nicely with just the first 5 lines. The conversation begins by describing the structure of the app. Once you acknowlege that's done, chatGPT 4 seems to be able to discuss the structure and you can begin to add "files" to the directory structure and tell it what the contents of the files are.

This project is based very loosely on Professor Synapse located here: https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Synapse_CoR/tree/main

It's meant to be a lean programming assistant. It doesn't get as wordy as Professor Synapse and helps keep the chat focused to discussing and building a small app.

After adding a couple of relavant commands the prompt is producing solid results.
